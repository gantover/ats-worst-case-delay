# Simulation files for different topologies

In this folder is a subfolder for each topology, furthermore there is a folder 'tsn'

The TSN folder should be moved to Omnet++ ./src/ folder, while the topology.ini files should be moved somewhere else in Omnet++ simulation workspace. Preferably a project-specific subfolder, as to not mix results.

The rest of the files are for our own analysis tool.
